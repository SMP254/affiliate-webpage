      <p>Not all water bottles are created equal. With so many options on Amazon, finding the right one can be tricky. Here are 10 things to consider before buying.</p>

      <h2>1. Choose the Right Material</h2>
      <p>Stainless steel is durable and keeps drinks cold. Plastic is lightweight, while glass is eco-friendly but fragile.</p>

      <h2>2. Size and Capacity</h2>
      <p>Are you looking for an everyday bottle (16–24 oz) or a hiking bottle (32–40 oz)? Pick based on lifestyle.</p>

      <h2>3. Insulation</h2>
      <p>If you want your drinks to stay cold or hot for hours, go for double-walled insulated bottles.</p>

      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The best water bottle is the one that fits your daily routine.</p>
