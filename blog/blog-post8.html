      <!-- Hacks Begin -->
      <h2 id="hack1">1. Use Your Cold Press Juicer as a Food Processor for Soft Foods</h2>
      <p>Did you know your cold press juicer can double as a soft-food processor? While it’s primarily designed to extract juice with minimal nutrient loss, its low-speed grinding mechanism is also ideal for making purees.</p>
      <p>Spin ripe or steamed produce like bananas, pears, or squash through the juicer slowly. Collect both pulp and juice, and blend together to form baby food, fruit spreads, or even ice pop bases.</p>
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Add a splash of almond milk or coconut water for a creamy texture.</p>

      <h2 id="hack2">2. Make Self-Stirring Soups with a Small Motor Fan</h2>
      <p>Have a USB-powered fan lying around? You can rig it with a food-safe blade mount to create a slow stirrer for sauces or soups. Mount it securely on the lid or pan edge, making sure it spins at low RPM.</p>
      <p>This hack keeps sauces from sticking or burning while you prep other ingredients. Great for risottos, custards, or melting chocolate.</p>
      <p><strong>Safety Note:</strong> Never use metal fan blades — plastic is safer and easier to clean.</p>

      <h2 id="hack3">3. Convert Your Smart Plug into a Brewing Timer</h2>
      <p>Pair your smart plug with a standard drip coffee maker (one that starts brewing when powered on). Program the plug to turn on 10 minutes before your alarm.</p>
      <p><strong>Result?</strong> Fresh coffee waiting as you wake up, without lifting a finger.</p>

      <h2 id="hack4">4. Use a Digital Kitchen Scale to Portion Your Meals</h2>
      <p>Your digital scale isn’t just for baking. Use it to weigh out portions during meal prep. This helps with calorie control, consistent macros, and less food waste.</p>
      <p>Set targets like 150g protein, 100g veggies, 50g carbs, and portion meals in advance. This also makes storing leftovers more efficient.</p>

      <h2 id="hack5">5. Turn a Rice Cooker into a Steamer Basket Hack</h2>
      <p>Most rice cookers have steam functionality built in. Place a metal or silicone tray above the water and cook rice and steamed veggies simultaneously.</p>
      <p><strong>Bonus:</strong> You can also steam dumplings, fish, or even reheat food evenly using this method.</p>

      <h2 id="hack6">6. Use Your Smartphone as a Sous Vide Monitor</h2>
      <p>If your sous vide device connects via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, pair it with your phone. Use timer apps or companion apps to monitor water temperature and doneness remotely.</p>
      <p>This is especially useful for slow cooking proteins like steak or eggs to perfection.</p>

      <h2 id="hack7">7. Use Your Blender to Make Hot Soup (Yes, Really)</h2>
      <p>Some high-speed blenders can create friction heat. Add hot broth and softened vegetables, then blend for 3–4 minutes. The result is a smooth, warm soup without using a pot.</p>
      <p><strong>Safety Tip:</strong> Leave the lid vented to let steam escape. Cover with a towel if needed to prevent splatter.</p>

      <h2 id="hack8">8. Use an Air Fryer Basket as a Toaster Oven for Mini Bakes</h2>
      <p>Your air fryer can double as a convection oven. Place small oven-safe dishes or silicone molds inside to bake brownies, eggs, or cookies in minutes.</p>
      <p>The rapid heat gives a crispy edge and faster cook times compared to a regular oven.</p>

      <h2 id="hack9">9. Repurpose Bluetooth Meat Thermometer for Baking</h2>
      <p>Insert your wireless probe into bread, muffins, or cake. Monitor internal temp from your phone to know when it’s done (98–100°C for bread).</p>
      <p>Great for gluten-free bakes or cheesecakes where doneness is hard to judge visually.</p>

      <h2 id="hack10">10. Use Your Water Bottle with Infuser Attachments</h2>
      <p>Infuser bottles aren’t just for lemon water. Add ground coffee and cold water for DIY cold brew overnight. Or add mint, cucumber, and strawberries for flavored water that rivals store-bought drinks.</p>

      <h2 id="bonus">Bonus Hack: Smart Reminders Using Voice Assistants</h2>
      <p>Pair Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri with kitchen routines. For example: say "Start baking" and have a 30-min timer and temperature reminder auto-triggered. Less forgetting, more cooking confidence.</p>

        <h2>Common Mistakes with Kitchen Gadgets</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Overuse of single-purpose tools:</strong> Don't limit an appliance to its label. Get creative.</li>
          <li><strong>Improper cleaning:</strong> Build-up affects flavor and longevity.</li>
          <li><strong>Wrong portioning:</strong> Even digital scales can mislead if used on uneven surfaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring manuals:</strong> Many gadgets have hidden features you’re missing out on!</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>Can I really make hot soup in a blender?</h3>
        <p>Yes! As long as your blender supports hot liquids or has a vented lid. Add hot ingredients, blend carefully, and let the friction heat do the rest.</p>

        <h3>Is it safe to repurpose fans or motors in the kitchen?</h3>
        <p>Only if they are clean, have food-safe parts, and you’re not exposing them directly to high heat or splashing liquids. Use caution and keep things well-mounted.</p>

        <h3>Do all coffee makers work with smart plugs?</h3>
        <p>No. It only works if the coffee maker starts brewing as soon as it's powered on — many newer ones have digital switches that prevent this.</p>

        <h3>Will using hacks void warranties?</h3>
        <p>Possibly, depending on how extreme the repurposing is. Avoid opening sealed units or modifying electronics unless you’re confident.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>You don’t need to buy a whole new kitchen to make it smarter. Creativity, not just connectivity, is the true sign of a smart cook. By repurposing and combining the gadgets you already own, you unlock massive value — and reduce clutter.</p>
      <p>Try one of these hacks today, and see how much time and energy it saves. The smartest kitchen is the one that works for you — not against you.</p>
